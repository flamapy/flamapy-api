<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

FLAMAPY API provides an abstraction layer over FLAMA, so that it can be used from any environment through requests to this API. In this way, we eliminate project dependencies and standardize a way to consume it for other applications.

Intended workflow explained:
* User deploys the API with Docker (see Instalation)
* User access the API, reads /api/v1/docs
* User can now start using the API

There are a few known bugs that we acknowledge, described in the projects section. If you detect any other new bug, please consider reporting it!
